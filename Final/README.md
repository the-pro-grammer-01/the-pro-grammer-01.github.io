# Agora-Workshop

# Final Project for Agora Workshop

An implementation of my own video chat app (Follow) using Agora's API. Features a login page and video call page.


# Concept 

Sometimes video just isn't enough and you need to see what others are doing in order to keep up with the flow. That's where Follow comes in! 

Everyone has the option of sharing their screen and showing others what they're up to. If you ever fall behind or if the instructor/leader/etc. is going to fast for your taste, look at others' screens for help or inspiration!

Just like ducklings, the ultimate goal is to follow the leader, but if you fall behind, it can be to your benefit to focus on someone else--to follow one of the other ducklings--in order to get to where you want to go. 


# Applications 

What is this useful for?

Follow's concept allows students to look at others' screens for additional assistance. This gives students the opportunity to figure things out for themselves without falling too far behind. 

From an instructor's perspective, Follow is also useful in that it lets one see what the students are doing and how they're progressing. Furthermore, it gives them the ability to point struggling students to others' work, thereby providing additional examples. 

This would work well for classes or workshops, whether for art, coding, or anything else!

Follow's concept also offers greater collaboration than the normal video calling service, since it allows for multiple people to share their screens at once. Follow therefore would work well for group projects, brainstorms, hackathons, and other collaborative efforts.


# Potential for Additional Features 

** Ability to click on screenshares and make them larger for easier viewing.

** Ability to rearrange order of screens displayed in follower div.

OR

** Ability to mark certain screens as favorites (for easier access).


# Disclaimer

This is simply a prototype and is by no means a fully functional project.
